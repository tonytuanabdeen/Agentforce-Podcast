### Environment

These applications requires licenses for the following features:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Start from a brand-new environment to avoid conflicts with previous work you may have done.
> Please start by signing up for a Developer Org @ developer.salesforce.com/signup.

#### Salesforce CLI

[Install the Salesforce CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/salesforcecli) or check that your installed CLI version is greater than `2.56.7` by running `sf -v` in a terminal.

If you need to [update the Salesforce CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_update_cli.htm), either run `sf update` or `npm install --global @salesforce/cli` depending on how you installed the CLI.

### Feature activation

1️⃣ Ensure that Data Cloud provisioning is complete before proceeding.

    To verify this, navigate to Data Cloud Setup. If you see a Get Started button, click it and allow the setup process to finish — this may take a few minutes.

2️⃣ Turn on Einstein.

    From **Setup**, go to **Einstein Setup** and click **Turn on Einstein**.

3️⃣ Turn on Agentforce Agents.

    From **Setup**, go to **Agentforce Agents**. You may need to refresh the page to see the Agentforce Agents menu after turning on Einstein.
    Toggle on **Agentforce**.

4️⃣ Turn on Einstein Bots.

    From **Setup**, go to **Einstein Bots**. Toggle on **Einstein Bots**.

### Repository & Org Setup

1️⃣ Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tonytuanabdeen/Agentforce-Podcast.git
    cd Agentforce-Podcast
    ```

2️⃣ Authorize your org with the Salesforce CLI, set it as the default org for this project and save an alias (`AF-Dev-target` in the command below).

    ```bash
    sf org login web -s -a AF-Dev-target
    ```

### Create the default Agentforce Agent User

    ```bash
    sf apex run -f apex-scripts/setup-agent-user.apex
    ```

### Metadata Deployment

#### Episode 01 - Agentforce - **Answer Questions with Knowledge**

1️⃣ Deploy the **af-knowledge-faq** metadata.

    ```bash
    sf project deploy start -d af-knowledge-faq
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > This package will deploy the required Permission Sets, enable Lightning Knowledge, and configure the Knowledge__kav custom field along with its page layout.
    > Most importantly, it will also deploy the Agentforce Agent – “Marhaba AI Agent”.

2️⃣ Assign the "Knowledge FAQ Access" permission set to the running user.

    ```bash
    sf org assign permset -n Knowledge_FAQ_Access
    ```

3️⃣ Assign the permission sets to the default Agent user.

    ```bash
    sf apex run -f apex-scripts/setup-permissionset-assignment.apex
    ```

4️⃣ Create a Knowledge Article record.

    ```bash
    sf apex run -f apex-scripts/setup-data-knowledge-article.apex
    ```

5️⃣ Now, open the “Marhaba AI Agent” and make the following two configuration updates:

    From **Setup**, navigate to **Agentforce Agents** and click **Marhaba AI Agent**.

    1. Update the Default Agent User

    > Click the inline **Pencil** icon to edit, and set the **Agent User** as the default Agent User.

    2. Create and Assign an Agentforce Data Library

    > Click Open in Builder, then go to the "Data" tab to create and assign an Agentforce Data Library to the agent.

    ```bash
    Library Name: "Knowledge Article FAQ Data Library "
    Data Type: "Knowledge"
    Data Space: "default"
    Identifying Field: "Title"
    Identifying Field: "Summary"
    Content Field: "Details"
    ```
